<h1>Exercise 2 – Interface Types</h1>

You need to know how Pac-Man works for this exercise. If you do not know the game,your first task is to play one of the many versions that can be found in the internet (e.g. <a href="https://www.webpacman.com/">https://www.webpacman.com/</a><a href="https://www.webpacman.com/">)</a>. Now consider the pros and cons of playing the same game using different interfaces. Consider a speechbased interface, a touch-based interface, a tangible interface and a virtual-reality and/or augmented reality interface (e.g. head-worn display).

For each interface type SUBMIT a description of how the game might be redesigned and SUBMIT an explanation of how the game would then be played (max 4 sentences per interface type). <em>Groups of 2: </em>choose 3 interface types.

BONUS: Imagine up to two other post-wimp interfaces. For each additional interface SUBMIT a description of what the interface is, a description of how the game might be adapted to suit the interface, and an explanation of the game would then be played (max 4 sentences per interface type).

<h1>Exercise 3 – Weekly pill case interface</h1>

any information you wish. Additionally, if you want, you could also imagine that the device is touch sensitive. Also, assume the case is connected to the internet or a smartphone via WiFi or Bluetooth.

SUBMIT descriptions of three possible functions/features in this setting that the case could offer (each in max. 3 sentences). For each, create and SUBMIT a sketch (including explanations of what the sketch depicts) of how the interface elements would look like. (<em>Groups of 2: </em>do the task for two examples).

Please make sure to scan/photograph your sketches in sufficiently high quality so that everything (especially text) is readable!
